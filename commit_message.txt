feat(performance): Migrate analysis from pandas to polars

Replaces pandas with polars in the core technical analysis logic to improve computational performance.

- Replaces `pandas` with `polars` in `requirements.txt`.
- Rewrites all indicator calculation functions in `technical_indicators.py` to use polars.
- The `recommendation_service.py` now converts the incoming pandas DataFrame to a polars DataFrame before analysis.

This addresses the "Acceleration of Computation" part of issue #939.
