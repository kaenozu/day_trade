feat(deploy): Add Gunicorn and Procfile for production

- Refactors `daytrade_web.py` to use the application factory pattern, making it compatible with WSGI servers like Gunicorn.
- Updates route modules to work with the new app factory structure.
- Adds `gunicorn.conf.py` for production server configuration.
- Creates a `Procfile` to define the `web` and `worker` processes for deployment.

This makes the application ready for production deployment and completes the performance improvement tasks for issue #939.
