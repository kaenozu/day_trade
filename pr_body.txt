This commit introduces and configures pre-commit hooks to automate code quality checks.
The following hooks are set up:
- `ruff`: For linting and static analysis.
- `ruff-format`: For code formatting, replacing `black`.
- `check-yaml`: For validating YAML files.
- `end-of-file-fixer`: Ensures files end with a newline.
- `trailing-whitespace`: Removes trailing whitespace.

This improves code consistency and helps maintain high code quality across the project.
